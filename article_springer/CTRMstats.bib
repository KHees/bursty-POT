abstract = {The life distribution $H(t)$ of a device subject to shocks governed by a Poisson process is considered as a function of the probabilities $P_k$ of not surviving the first $k$ shocks. Various properties of the discrete failure distribution $P_k$ are shown to be reflected in corresponding properties of the continuous life distribution $H(t)$. As an example, if $P_k$ has discrete increasing hazard rate, then $H(t)$ has continuous increasing hazard rate. Properties of $P_k$ are obtained from various physically motivated models, including that in which damage resulting from shocks accumulates until exceedance of a threshold results in failure. We extend our results to continuous wear processes. Applications of interest in renewal theory are obtained. Total positivity theory is used in deriving many of the results.},

We show that in both data sets the relevant quantities (probability density functions and the autocorrelation function of the interoccurrence times, as well as the conditional return period) are governed by power laws with exponents that depend explicitly on the considered threshold. By studying a large number of representative financial records (market indices, stock prices, exchange rates, and commodities), we show explicitly that the interoccurrence times between large daily returns follow the same behavior, in a nearly quantitative manner.

abstract = {Extreme value theory is used to derive asymptotically motivated models for unusual or rare events, e.g. the upper or lower tails of a distribution. A new flexible extreme value mixture model is proposed combining a non-parametric kernel density estimator for the bulk of the distribution with an appropriate tail model. The complex uncertainties associated with threshold choice are accounted for and new insights into the impact of threshold choice on density and quantile estimates are obtained. Bayesian inference is used to account for all uncertainties and enables inclusion of expert prior information, potentially overcoming the inherent sparsity of extremal data. A simulation study and empirical application for determining normal ranges for physiological measurements for pre-term infants is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mixture model. The potential of the proposed model for overcoming the lack of consistency of likelihood based kernel bandwidth estimators when faced with heavy tailed distributions is also demonstrated. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Inhomogeneous temporal processes, like those appearing in human communications, neuron spike trains, and seismic signals, consist of high-activity bursty intervals alternating with long low-activity periods. In recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed inter-event time distribution, while temporal correlations were measured by the autocorrelation function. However, these characteristic functions are not capable to fully characterize temporally correlated heterogenous behavior. Here we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves as a good indicator of the dependencies, leading to the universal observation of power-law distribution for a broad class of phenomena. We find that the correlations in these quite different systems can be commonly interpreted by memory effects and described by a simple phenomenological model, which displays temporal behavior qualitatively similar to that in real systems.},

abstract = {Social, technological, and economic time series are divided by events which are usually assumed to be random, albeit with some hierarchical structure. It is well known that the interevent statistics observed in these contexts differs from the Poissonian profile by being long-tailed distributed with resting and active periods interwoven. Understanding mechanisms generating consistent statistics has therefore become a central issue. The approach we present is taken from the continuous-time random-walk formalism and represents an analytical alternative to models of nontrivial priority that have been recently proposed. Our analysis also goes one step further by looking at the multifractal structure of the interevent times of human decisions. We here analyze the intertransaction time intervals of several financial markets. We observe that empirical data describe a subtle multifractal behavior. Our model explains this structure by taking the pausing-time density in the form of a superstatistics where the integral kernel quantifies the heterogeneous nature of the executed tasks. A stretched exponential kernel provides a multifractal profile valid for a certain limited range. A suggested heuristic analytical profile is capable of covering a broader region.},

abstract = {Halting a computer or biological virus outbreak requires a detailed understanding of the timing of the interactions between susceptible and infected individuals. While current spreading models assume that users interact uniformly in time, following a Poisson process, a series of recent measurements indicates that the intercontact time distribution is heavy tailed, corresponding to a temporally inhomogeneous bursty contact process. Here we show that the non-Poisson nature of the contact dynamics results in prevalence decay times significantly larger than predicted by the standard Poisson process based models. Our predictions are in agreement with the detailed time resolved prevalence data of computer viruses, which, according to virus bulletins, show a decay time close to a year, in contrast with the 1 day decay predicted by the standard Poisson process based models.},

The role of EVT is to allow the development of procedures that are scientifically and statistically rational to estimate the extreme behavior of random processes. We have performed extensive simulation experiments by taking traffic data that is greater than a given threshold value. The results of our experiments and analysis show the wireless network traffic model obtained through the EVT fits well with the empirical distribution of traffic. Meanwhile, we can obtain EVT model has the lowest "average deviation" compared with other popular distribution model such as exponential, lognormal, gamma, Weibull. Thus illustrates EVT is more suitable than other distributions to model the traffic and it has a good application foreground in the analysis of wireless network traffic.},

We find that in all cases, PQ(r) follows the form PQ(r)∝1/[(1+(q− 1)$\beta$r]1/(q−1), where $\beta$ and q are universal constants that depend only on RQ, but not on a specific asset. While $\beta$ depends only slightly on RQ, the q-value increases logarithmically with RQ, q=1+q0 ln(RQ/2), such that for RQ→2, PQ(r) approaches a simple exponential, PQ(r)cong2−r. The fact that PQ does not scale with RQ is due to the multifractality of the financial markets. The analytic form of PQ allows also to estimate both the risk function and the Value-at-Risk, and thus to improve the estimation of the financial risk.},

abstract = {The backward jump modification of the continuous-time random walk model or the version of the model driven by the negative feedback was herein derived for spatiotemporal continuum in the context of a share price evolution on a stock exchange. In the frame of the model, we described stochastic evolution of a typical share price on a stock exchange with a moderate liquidity within a high-frequency time scale. The model was validated by satisfactory agreement of the theoretical velocity autocorrelation function with its empirical counterpart obtained for the continuous quotation. This agreement is mainly a result of a sharp backward correlation found and considered in this article. This correlation is a reminiscence of such a bid-ask bounce phenomenon where backward price jump has the same or almost the same length as preceding jump. We suggested that this correlation dominated the dynamics of the stock market with moderate liquidity. Although assumptions of the model were inspired by the market high-frequency empirical data, its potential applications extend beyond the financial market, for instance, to the field covered by the Le Chatelier-Braun principle of contrariness.},

@article{Vitolo2009a,
abstract = {This study has investigated how clustering of wintertime extra-tropical cyclones depends on the vorticity intensity of the windstorms, and the sampling time period over which storm transits are counted. Clustering is characterized by the dispersion (ratio of the variance and the mean) of the counts of eastward transits of storm tracks obtained by objective tracking of 850hPa vorticity features in NCEP-NCAR reanalyses. The counts are aggregated over non-overlapping time periods lasting from 4 days up to whole 6 month long October-March winters over the period 1950-2003. Clustering is found to be largest in the exit region of the North Atlantic storm track (i.e. over NE Atlantic and NWEurope). Furthermore, it increases considerably for more intense storms, for example, the dispersion of the 3-monthly counts near Berlin increases from 1.45 for all storms to 1.80 for the 25% most intense storms. The dispersion also increases quasi-linearly with the logarithm of the length of the aggregation period, for example, near Berlin the dispersion is 1.08, 1.33, and 1.45 for weekly, monthly, and 3-monthly totals, respectively. The increases and the sampling uncertainties in dispersion can be reproduced using a simple Poisson regression model with a time-varying rate that depends on large-scale teleconnection indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, the East Atlantic Pattern, the Scandinavian pattern, and the East Atlantic/West Russia pattern. Increased dispersion for more intense storms is found to be due to the rate becoming more dependent on the indices for such storms,whereas increased dispersion for longer aggregation periods is related to the small amounts of long-lead serial correlation in the indices. Increased clustering with storm intensity and aggregation period has important implications for the accurate modelling of aggregate insurance losses.},

In the case where the energy distance is computed with the semimetric of negative type, a positive definite kernel, termed distance kernel, may be defined such that the MMD corresponds exactly to the energy distance. Conversely, for any positive definite kernel, we can interpret the MMD as energy distance with respect to some negative-type semimetric. This equivalence readily extends to distance covariance using kernels on the product space. We determine the class of probability distributions for which the test statistics are consistent against all alternatives. Finally, we investigate the performance of the family of distance kernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular that the energy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one member of a parametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this family can yield more powerful tests.},

Extensions have been introduced where nodes attach proportionally to arbitrary fitness functions. However, in these models, attaching to a node always increases the ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth where nodes attach proportionally to the clustering coefficients, or local densities of triangles, of existing nodes. Attaching to a node typically lowers its clustering coefficient, in contrast to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer models. This simple modification naturally leads to a variety of rich phenomena, including aging, non-Poissonian bursty dynamics, and community formation. This theoretical model shows that complex network structure can be generated without artificially imposing multiple dynamical mechanisms and may reveal potentially overlooked mechanisms present in complex systems.},

In the case where the waiting times between observations have an infinite mean, a limit theorem is established, where the limit is comprised of an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the non-Markovian hitting time process for a stable subordinator. The resulting limit distributions are shown to be solutions of fractional differential equations, where the order of the fractional time derivative coincides with the power law index of the waiting time. The probability that the limit process remains below a threshold is also computed. For waiting times with finite mean but infinite variance, a two-scale argument yields a fundamentally different limit process. The resulting limit is an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the first passage time of a positively skewed stable L??vy motion with positive drift. This two-scale limit provides a second-order correction to the usual limit behavior. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The continuous time random walk, introduced in the physics literature by Montroll and Weiss, has been widely used to model anomalous diffusion in external force fields. One of the features of this model is that the governing equations for the evolution of the probability density function, in the diffusion limit, can generally be simplified using fractional calculus. This has in turn led to intensive research efforts over the past decade to develop robust numerical methods for the governing equations, represented as fractional partial differential equations. Here we introduce a discrete time random walk that can also be used to model anomalous diffusion in an external force field. The governing evolution equations for the probability density function share the continuous time random walk diffusion limit. Thus the discrete time random walk provides a novel numerical method for solving anomalous diffusion equations in the diffusion limit, including the fractional Fokker-Planck equation. This method has the clear advantage that the discretisation of the diffusion limit equation, which is necessary for numerical analysis, is itself a well defined physical process. Some examples using the discrete time random walk to provide numerical solutions of the probability density function for anomalous subdiffusion, including forcing, are provided.

We introduce the general framework of temporal motifs to study the mesoscale spatio-temporal structure of these networks. Temporal motifs are classes of similar event sequences, where the similarity refers not only to topology but also to the temporal order of the events. We provide a mapping from event sequences and to colored directed graphs that enables an efficient algorithm for identifying temporal motifs. We discuss some aspects of temporal motifs, including causality and null models, and present basic statistics of temporal motifs in a large mobile call network.},

abstract = {The time histogram is a fundamental tool for representing the inhomogeneous density of event occurrences such as neuronal firings. The shape of a histogram critically depends on the size of the bins that partition the time axis. In most neurophysiological studies, however, researchers have arbitrarily selected the bin size when analyzing fluctuations in neuronal activity. A rigorous method for selecting the appropriate bin size was recently derived so that the mean integrated squared error between the time histogram and the unknown underlying rate is minimized (Shimazaki & Shinomoto, 2007 ). This derivation assumes that spikes are independently drawn from a given rate. However, in practice, biological neurons express non-Poissonian features in their firing patterns, such that the spike occurrence depends on the preceding spikes, which inevitably deteriorate the optimization. In this letter, we revise the method for selecting the bin size by considering the possible non-Poissonian features. Improvement in the goodness of fit of the time histogram is assessed and confirmed by numerically simulated non-Poissonian spike trains derived from the given fluctuating rate. For some experimental data, the revised algorithm transforms the shape of the time histogram from the Poissonian optimization method.},

We further exhibit the asymptotic behaviour of the covariation of the increments of the components of a multivariate Hawkes process, when the observations are imposed by a discrete scheme with mesh ∆ over [0,T] up to some further time shift $\tau$. The behaviour of this functional depends on the relative size of ∆ and $\tau$ with respect to T and enables to give a full account of the second-order structure. As an application, we develop our results in the context of financial statistics. We introduced in [17] a micro- scopic stochastic model for the variations of a multivariate financial asset, based on Hawkes processes and that is confined to live on a tick grid. We derive and characterise the exact macroscopic diffusion limit of this model and show in particular its ability to reproduce important empirical stylised fact such as the Epps effect and the lead-lag effect. Moreover, our approach enable to track these effects across scales in rigorous mathematical terms.},

A fundamental result common to the different approaches is that the mean square displacement of a diffusing particle scales linearly with time. However there have been numerous experimental measurements in which the mean square displacement of diffusing particles scales as a fractional order power law in time. In recent years a great deal of progress has been made in extending the different models for diffusion to incorporate this fractional diffusion. The tools of fractional calculus have proven very useful in these developments, linking together fractional constitutive laws, continuous time random walks, fractional Langevin equations and fractional Brownian motions. These notes provide a tutorial style overview of standard and fractional diffusion processes.},

abstract = {We study the statistics of return intervals between large heartbeat intervals (above a certain threshold Q) in 24 h records obtained from healthy subjects. We find that both the linear and the nonlinear long-term memory inherent in the heartbeat intervals lead to power-laws in the probability density function P(Q)(r) of the return intervals. As a consequence, the probability W(Q)(t; Delta t) that at least one large heartbeat interval will occur within the next Delta t heartbeat intervals, with an increasing elapsed number of intervals t after the last large heartbeat interval, follows a power-law. Based on these results, we suggest a method of obtaining a priori information about the occurrence of the next large heartbeat interval, and thus to predict it. We show explicitly that the proposed method, which exploits long-term memory, is superior to the conventional precursory pattern recognition technique, which focuses solely on short-term memory. We believe that our results can be straightforwardly extended to obtain more reliable predictions in other physiological signals like blood pressure, as well as in other complex records exhibiting multifractal behaviour, e.g. turbulent flow, precipitation, river flows and network traffic.},

A number of commonly used models are valid for observed data that exceed some high threshold. However, in practice a suitable threshold is unknown and must be determined for each analysis. While there are many threshold selection methods for univariate extremes, there are relatively few that can be applied in the multivariate setting. In addition, there are only a few Bayesian-based methods, which are naturally attractive in the modelling of extremes due to data scarcity. The use of Bayesian measures of surprise to determine suitable thresholds for extreme value models is proposed. Such measures quantify the level of support for the proposed extremal model and threshold, without the need to specify any model alternatives.
