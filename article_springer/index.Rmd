abstract: |
  In many complex systems studied in statistical physics, 
  inter-arrival times between events such as solar flares, trades and 
  neuron voltages follow a heavy-tailed 
  distribution. The set of event times is fractal-like, being dense in some 
  time windows and empty in others, a phenomenon which has been dubbed 
  "bursty". 
  
  This article generalizes the Peaks Over Threshold (POT) model to the setting 
  where inter-event times are heavy-tailed. For high thresholds and 
  infinite-mean waiting times, we show that the times between threshold 
  crossings are Mittag-Leffler distributed, and thus form a "fractional 
  Poisson Process" which generalizes the standard Poisson Process.
  We provide graphical means of estimating model parameters and assessing 
  model fit. Along the way, we apply our inference method to a real-world
  bursty time series, and 
  show how the memory of the Mittag-Leffler distribution affects 
  the predictive distribution for the time until the next extreme event.
