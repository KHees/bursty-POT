  \begin{abstract}
  In many complex systems studied in statistical physics, inter-arrival
  times between events such as solar flares, trades and neuron voltages
  follow a heavy-tailed distribution. The set of event times is
  fractal-like, being dense in some time windows and empty in others, a
  phenomenon which has been dubbed ``bursty''.
  
  This article proposes a new model for the \emph{inter-exceedance times}
  of events above high thresholds; the threshold exceedances itself are
  modeled via the standard Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method. For high
  thresholds and infinite-mean waiting times, we show that the times
  between threshold crossings are Mittag-Leffler distributed, and thus
  form a ``fractional Poisson Process'' which generalizes the standard
  Poisson Process of threshold exceedances. We provide graphical means of
  estimating model parameters and assessing model fit. Along the way, we
  apply our inference method to a real-world bursty time series, and show
  how the memory of the Mittag-Leffler distribution affects the predictive
  distribution for the time until the next extreme event.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Time series displaying temporally inhomogeneous behaviour in terms of
the occurrence of events have received strong interest in the recent
statistical physics literature (Bagrow and Brockmann, 2013; Barabási,
2005; Karsai et al., 2011; Min et al., 2011; Oliveira and Barabási,
2005; Omi and Shinomoto, 2011; Vasquez et al., 2006; Vazquez et al.,
2007). They have been observed in the context of earthquakes, sunspots,
neuronal activity and human communication (see Karsai et al., 2012;
Meerschaert and Stoev, 2008 for a list of references; Vajna et al.,
2013). Such time series exhibit high activity in some `bursty'
intervals, which alternate with other, quiet intervals. Although several
mechanisms are plausible explanations for bursty behaviour (most
prominently self-exciting point process by Hawkes (1971)), there seems
to be one salient feature which very typically indicates the departure
from temporal homogeneity: a heavy-tailed distribution of waiting times
(Karsai et al., 2012; Vajna et al., 2013; Vasquez et al., 2006). As we
show below in simulations, a simple renewal process with heavy-tailed
waiting times can capture this type of dynamics. For many systems, the
renewal property is appropriate; a simple test of the absence of
correlations in a succession of waiting times can be undertaken by
randomly reshuffling the waiting times (Karsai et al., 2012).

Often a magnitude, or mark can be assigned to each event in the renewal
process, such as for earthquakes, solar flares or neuron voltages. The
Peaks-Over-Threshold model (POT, see e.g.~Coles, 2001) applies a
threshold to the magnitudes, and fits a Generalized Pareto distribution
to the threshold exceedances. A commonly made assumption in POT models
is that times between events are either fixed or light-tailed, and this
entails that the threshold crossing times form a Poisson process (``On
the Exceedance Point Process for a Stationary Sequence,'' 1988). Then as
one increases the threshold \(\ell\) and thus decreases the threshold
crossing probability \(p_{\ell}\), the Poisson process is rarefied,
i.e.~its intensity decreases \emph{linearly} with \(p_{\ell}\) (see
e.g.~Beirlant et al., 2006).

As will be shown below, in the heavy-tailed waiting time scenario
threshold crossing times form a \emph{fractional Poisson process}
(Laskin, 2003; Meerschaert et al., 2011), which is a renewal process
with Mittag-Leffler distributed waiting times. The family of
Mittag-Leffler distributions nests the exponential distribution (Haubold
et al., 2011), and hence the fractional Poisson process generalizes the
standard Poisson process. Again as the threshold size \(\ell\) increases
and the threshold crossing probability \(p_{\ell}\) decreases, the
fractional Poisson process is rarefied: The scale parameter of the
Mittag-Leffler inter-arrival times of threshold crossing times
increases, but \emph{superlinearly}; see the Theorem below.

Maxima of events which occur according to a renewal process with
heavy-tailed waiting times have been studied under the names
``Continuous Time Random Maxima process'' (CTRM) (Benson et al., 2007;
Hees and Scheffler, 2018a, 2018b; Meerschaert and Stoev, 2008),
``Max-Renewal process'' (Basrak and Špoljarić, 2015; Silvestrov, 2002;
Silvestrov and Teugels, 2004), and ``Shock process'' (Anderson, 1987;
Esary and Marshall, 1973; Gut and Hüsler, 1999; Shanthikumar and Sumita,
1985, 1984, 1983). The existing literature focuses on probabilistic
results surrounding these models. In this work, however, we introduce a
method of inference for this type of model, which is seemingly not
available in the literature.

We review the marked renewal process in Section 2, and derive a scaling
limit theorem for inter-exceedance times in Section 3. We give a
statistical procedure to estimate model parameters via stability plots
in Section 5, but to set the stage we first discuss inference for the
Mittag-Leffler distribution in Section 4. A simulation study of the
effectiveness of our statistical procedure is given in Section 6. In
Section 7 we apply our method to a real data set. In Section 8, we
discuss the memory property of the Mittag-Leffler distribution, and how
it affects the predictive distribution for the time until the next
threshold crossing event. Finally we close with a discussion and
conclusion in Section 9. For all statistical computations we have used R
(R Core Team, 2018). All code and data used for the analysis in this
article has been organized into an R package \texttt{CTRE}
(\url{https://github.com/strakaps/CTRE}). The source code for the
figures generated in this manuscript is available online at

\section{Continuous Time Random Exceedances
(CTRE)}\label{continuous-time-random-exceedances-ctre}}

As a model for extreme observations, we use a Marked Renewal Process
(MRP):

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Definition (MRP):}]
Let \((W,J), (W_1, J_1), (W_2, J_2), \ldots\) be i.i.d. pairs of random
variables, where the \(W_k > 0\) are interpreted as the \emph{waiting
times} and \(J_k \in \mathbb{R}\) as the \emph{event magnitudes}. If
\(W\) and \(J\) are independent, the Marked Renewal Process is said to
be \emph{uncoupled}.
\end{description}

In the following we denote with \(x_L \in [-\infty, +\infty)\) and
\(x_R \in (-\infty, +\infty]\) the left and right endpoint of the
distribution of \(J\). We assume that the \(k\)-th magnitude \(J_k\)
occurs at time \(T_k = W_1 + \ldots + W_k\). Based on a MRP, we define
the Continuous Time Random Exceedance model (CTRE) as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Definition (CTRE):}]
Given a threshold \(\ell \in (x_L, x_R)\), consider the stopping time
\[\tau(\ell) := \min\{k: J_k > \ell\},\quad \ell \in (x_L, x_R).\]
Define the pair of random variables \((X(\ell), T(\ell))\) via
\[X(\ell) = J_{\tau(\ell)} - \ell, \quad 
T(\ell) = \sum_{k=1}^{\tau(\ell)} W_k.\] By restarting the MRP at
\(\tau(\ell)\), inductively define the two i.i.d. sequences
\(T(\ell,n)\) and \(X(\ell, n)\), \(n \in \mathbb N\), called the
``inter-arrival times'' and the ``exceedances'', respectively. The pair
sequence \((X(\ell, n), T(\ell, n))_{n \in \mathbb N}\) is called a
Continuous Time Random Exceedance model (CTRE). If the underlying MRP is
uncoupled, then the CTRE is also called uncoupled.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}

Upper picture: Simulated data with stable distributed waiting times. Lower picture: Solar flares during 1982.}\label{fig:thresholdedBursty}
\end{figure}

In this article, we restrict ourselves to the uncoupled case, where
\(W\) and \(J\) are independent. Then the two sequences
\(X(\ell, n)_{n \in \mathbb N}\) and \(T(\ell, n)_{n \in \mathbb N}\)
are independent as well. To see why, note that \(X(\ell)\) is, in
distribution, simply equal to \(J - \ell | J > \ell\), independent of
any waiting time \(W_k\).\\
We assume for the rest of the article, that the magnitudes
\((J_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\) belong to the the max-domain of attraction
of some non-degenerate distribution. This means there exist \(a_n>0\)
and \(d_n \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \begin{align} \label{assumptionJs}
a_n^{-1}(J_1 \vee \ldots \vee J_n -d_n) \Rightarrow A \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty.
\end{align} Hence, the distribution of \(A\) is a generalized extreme
value distribution (GEV) which distribution function is given by
\[ F(x;\xi) = \begin{cases}\exp(-(1+\xi x)^{-1/\xi}) & \xi\neq0 \\ \exp(-\exp(-x)) & \xi = 0\end{cases}.\]
The GEV is subdivided into the Gumbel (\(\xi=0\)), the Weibull
(\(\xi<0\)) and the Fréchet (\(\xi>0\)) family of distributions.

Figure \ref{fig:thresholdedBursty} shows a simulated dataset in the top
panel, where \(W\) has a stable distribution with tail parameter
\(\beta =\) 0.8 (and skewness \(1\) and location \(0\)), and where \(J\)
is from a standard Gumbel distribution. In the bottom panel, we plot a
time series of solar flare intensities derived from a NASA dataset
(Dennis et al., 1991) which we will later examine more closely (see
Section 7). Clearly, the simulated data exhibit long intervals
\emph{without any} events, whereas in the real-world dataset events
appear continuously. The threshold exceedances, however, appear to have
visually similar statistical behaviour in both models. Observations
below a threshold are commonly discarded in Extreme Value Theory (POT
approach); likewise, the CTRE model interprets these observations as
noise and discards them.

\hypertarget{sec:scaling}{%
\section{Scaling limit of Exceedance Times}\label{sec:scaling}}

In this section we state and prove the key theorem. For an accessible
introduction to regular variation and stable limit theorems, we
recommend the book by Meerschaert and Sikorskii (2012).

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Theorem:}]
For the magnitudes \(J_k\) assumption \eqref{assumptionJs} holds.
Furthermore, let the waiting times \(W_k\) be in the domain of
attraction of a positively skewed sum-stable law with stability
parameter \(0 < \beta < 1\); more precisely,
\begin{align} \label{eq:stability}
\frac{W_1 + \ldots + W_n}{b(n)} \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} D, 
\quad n \to \infty
\end{align} for a function \(b(n)\) which is regularly varying at
\(\infty\) with parameter \(1/\beta\), and where
\(\mathbf E[\exp(-sD)] = \exp(-s^\beta)\). Write
\(p_{\ell} := \mathbf P(J > \ell)\). Then the weak convergence \[
\frac{T(\ell)} {b(1/p_{\ell})} \to Z_\beta \quad \text{ as } \quad \ell \uparrow x_R
\] holds, where the Mittag-Leffler random variable \(Z_\beta\) is
defined on the positive real numbers via \[
\mathbf E[\exp(-sZ_\beta)] = \frac{1}{1+s^\beta}.
\]
\end{description}

\emph{Proof of Theorem:} Due to assumption \eqref{assumptionJs}, it
follows \begin{align*}
    P\left(\frac{M(c)-d(c)}{a(c)} \leq x\right) \rightarrow F(x) \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,
    \end{align*} where \(x\) is any value from the support of \(F\).
Then it follows, \begin{align*}
      F(xa(c)+d(c))^{\lfloor c \rfloor} &\rightarrow F(x) \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,\\
      \Rightarrow  \lfloor c \rfloor \log F(\ell_c)  &\rightarrow \log F(x)\text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,
    \end{align*} with \(\ell_c:=xa(c)+d(c)\). Furthermore, since
\(\log(1-x) \sim -x\) for small \(x\) it follows \begin{align}
      c \cdot p(\ell_c) \rightarrow -\log F_A(x)  \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,\label{eq:lplconv}
    \end{align} with \(p(\ell_c):= 1-F(\ell_c)\). Since
\(\tau(\ell_c) \sim Geo(p(\ell_c))\) and \eqref{eq:lplconv} it follows
that \(\tau(\ell_c)/c\) converges to an Exponential distributed random
variable, \begin{align*}
    \frac{\tau(\ell_c)}{c} \Rightarrow E  \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty
    \end{align*} with inverse mean \(\lambda:=-\log F_A(x)\). Due to
\begin{align*}
    S(c):= \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor c \rfloor} \frac{W_i}{b(c)} \Rightarrow D \ \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,
    \end{align*} it follows with Gnedenkos transfer theorem (see
Gnedenko (1983)), that \begin{align}
    \sum_{i=1}^{ \tau(\ell_c)} \frac{W_i}{b(\ell_c)}  \Rightarrow Z\ \text{ as }  c \rightarrow \infty, \label{TheoGutArg}
    \end{align} where the distribution of \(Z\) has the characteristic
function \begin{align}
    \Psi(s) &= \int_0^{\infty} (\Phi_D(s))^{y} F_E(dy) \nonumber\\
    &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{1-\log(\Phi_D(s))/\lambda} \nonumber\\
    &= \frac{1}{1+s^{\beta}\lambda^{-1}}
    \end{align} where \(\Phi_D(s) = \exp(-s^\beta)\) is the Laplace
transform of \(D\) and \(F_E(dy)\) is the distribution function of
\(E\). Hence, \(Z\) is Mittag-Leffler distributed with parameter
\(\lambda^{-1/\beta}\). Rewriting \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{ \tau(\ell_c)} \frac{W_i}{b(1/p(\ell_c))} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{ \tau(\ell_c)} \frac{W_i}{b(c) }\right) \frac{b(c)}{b(1/p(\ell_c))}  
    \end{align*} and \begin{align*}
    \frac{b(c)}{b(1/p(\ell_c))} = \frac{b(c)}{b(c/(p(\ell_c)c))} \sim (p(\ell_c) \cdot c)^{1/\beta} \rightarrow \lambda^{1/\beta} \text{ as } c \rightarrow \infty,
    \end{align*} the second factor converges to \(\lambda^{1/\beta}\),
and it follows that \(Z \sim ML(\beta,1)\). Since
\(c \rightarrow \infty\) is equivalent to \(\ell \uparrow x_R\), the
assertion follows with \(\ell:=\ell_c\) and \(p_\ell:=p(\ell_c)\). \qed

For a scale parameter \(\sigma > 0\), we write
\({\rm ML}(\beta, \sigma)\) for the distribution of \(\sigma Z_\beta\).
The Mittag-Leffler distribution with parameter \(\beta \in (0,1]\) is a
heavy-tailed positive distribution for \(\beta < 1\), with infinite
mean. However, as \(\beta \uparrow 1\), \({\rm ML}(\beta, \sigma)\)
converges weakly to the exponential distribution \({\rm Exp}(\sigma)\)
with mean \(\sigma\). This means that although its moments are all
infinite, the Mittag-Leffler distribution may (if \(\beta\) is close to
1) be indistinguishable from the exponential distribution, for the
purposes of applied statistics.

We caution the reader that, somewhat confusingly, there is another
distribution called the ``light-tailed'' Mittag-Leffler distribution.
This is in fact the limiting distribution of the renewal process
\(N(t)\) above (see Meerschaert and Scheffler (2004)). For a detailed
reference on the Mittag-Leffler distribution, see e.g.~ Haubold et al.
(2011), and for algorithms, see e.g.~the R package
\texttt{MittagLeffleR} (Gill and Straka, 2017).

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Remark:}]
If \(\beta = 1\), the result of the Theorem above is standard, see e.g.~
Equation (2.2) in Gut and Hüsler (1999). In Anderson (1987) a similar
result is shown with a different choice of scaling constant.
\item[\textbf{Remark:}]
When \(0 < \beta < 1\), the renewal process \(N(t)\) is \emph{not
stationary}, and hence the results by (``On the Exceedance Point Process
for a Stationary Sequence,'' 1988) on the exceedances of stationary
sequences do not apply.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{sec:ML}{%
\section{Model Choice and inference for the Mittag-Leffler
distribution}\label{sec:ML}}

The classical POT approach is based on the fact that exceedances above a
high threshold are asymptotically GPD distributed, hence a GPD
distribution is fitted to the exceedances above a high enough threshold.
As this approach is by now well-established in extreme value theory, we
do not discuss it any further. Instead, this article focuses on our new
contribution: the modelling of inter-exceedance times. For literature
pointing to POT see e.g.~Smith (1984); Leadbetter (1991); Davison and
Smith (1990); Beirlant et al. (2006) Ch.5.3; Embrechts et al. (2013) Ch.
6.5.; Coles (2001) Ch.4.

Due to the Theorem in the last Section we know that for high thresholds
the times between exceedances are asymptotically Mittag-Leffler
distributed in case of heavy-tailed waiting times between the
observations. In this article we propose to model inter-exceedance times
in a similar fashion as magnitudes in the classical POT approach, more
precisely to fit a Mittag-Leffler distribution to the inter-exceedance
times via stability plots. Hence, before we discuss inference for the
inter-exceedance times in the next section, we first discuss inference
for Mittag-Leffler distributions.

Historically, the first method proposed for the estimation of the
Mittag-Leffler distribution parameters was the fractional moment
estimator by Kozubowski (2001). Unlike the first moments, the fractional
moments of order \(p\) for \(p<\beta\) exist and are tractable. One
drawback of this method is that constant priors for the tail parameter
are needed for the calculation of the estimates. Cahoy et al. (2010)
proposed a moment estimator of the log-transformed data, which does not
require any prior. Furthermore, they performed simulation studies
illustrating that the log-Moment outperforms the fractional moment
estimator with respect to bias and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Due to the form of the density function of a Mittag-Leffler distribution
there exists no closed form for the Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE).
In the R Package \texttt{MittagLeffleR} (Gill and Straka, 2017), Maximum
Likelihood estimation is implemented via numerical optimization. The MLE
slightly outperforms the log-Moment estimator regarding bias and RMSE
for big enough sample sizes, but is extremely computationally intensive.
Figure \ref{fig:MSE} shows that both estimators perform well, even for
small sample sizes. For smaller tails both estimators show an increasing
rmse for the scale estimation due to an increasing variance. This
results from the fact that in case of very small tails, single very
large values can occur.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{article_springer_files/figure-latex/MSE-1} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:MSE} Rmse for the estimation of tail (left column) and scale (right column) parameters via log-Moment estimator and MLE of a Mittag-Leffler sample with varying sample size n=25, 100, 200, varying tails on the x-axis and fixed scale equal to one, based on 5000 simulation runs.}\label{fig:MSE}
\end{figure}

Since the Mittag-Leffler distribution is heavy-tailed, many researchers
would intuitively give the highest importance to the tail behaviour of
the distribution. Of course, one can also use established tail exponent
estimators for the estimation of the parameter \(\beta\) such as the
Hill estimator (Hill, 1975) based on the \(r+1\) upper order statistics
\begin{align}\label{eq:Hill}
H_{r,n}=\left[ \frac{1}{r} \sum_{i=0}^{r} \log \frac{X_{(i)}}{X_{(r+1)}}\right]^{-1}, 
\end{align} where \(X_{(1)} \geq X_{(2)} \geq \ldots \geq X_{(n)}\)
denote the order statistics in decreasing order of a sequence
\(X_1,\ldots,X_n\). The Hill estimator only performs reliably well for
distributions close to Pareto (see Resnick, 1997). It heavily depends on
the choice of \(r\) in \eqref{eq:Hill}, and hence on the number of order
statistics entering \eqref{eq:Hill}. Figure \ref{fig:Hillplots} shows
100 Hill plots (grey thin lines) for simulated Mittag-Leffler data with
tail parameter \(\beta=0.8\) and scale \(\sigma=1\), for a sample size
of \(n=200\) (left) and \(n=1000\) (right). The dark lines are the means
and the red dotted lines show the true tail parameter. To deduce the
correct tail parameter estimates from one of those Hillplots is
virtually impossible. To estimate the tail parameter of a Mittag-Leffler
distribution with the Hill estimator, the sample size has to be much
larger and one has to choose a small tuning parameter \(r\). In case
that only events above a high threshold are recorded, \(n=10000\) events
are extremely unrealistic. There is a vast literature on bias-reduced
versions of the Hill estimator and on the optimal choice of \(r\),
mainly based on imposed second-order regular variation conditions (see
e.g.~Beirlant et al., 2006, p. Ch.4.4 and 4.7 and references in it).
Also, there are hundreds other tail-index estimators not considered in
this article, since this would go beyond the scope of our article. For
example the moment estimator (Dekkers et al., 1989), the Pickands
estimator (Pickands III and others, 1975), the QQ-estimator (Kratz and
Resnick, 1996), to name a few. A nice overview can be found in
(Fedotenkov, 2018). However, we know from the Theorem in Section
\ref{sec:scaling} that the inter-exceedance times are asymptotically
Mittag-Leffler distributed, and hence it is unsurprising that general
tail (and scale) estimation methods that do not take into account this
structure are statistically less efficient (Kozubowski, 2001). Finally,
the Hill estimator completely fails in the important special case where
the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed and not
heavy-tailed. For these reasons, we propose to use the log-Moment
estimator or the MLE for Mittag-Leffler distributions.

\begin{figure}

The grey thin lines are the Hill plots for the different simulation runs and the dark lines are their means. The red dotted line shows the true tail parameter. }\label{fig:Hillplots}
\end{figure}

Since the exponential distribution is nested in the Mittag-Leffler
family of distributions, a Likelihood-ratio Test (LRT) seems to be an
appropriate way to choose between a model with exponential and
Mittag-Leffler inter-exceedance times. Although the two models are
nested, the asymptotic distribution is not \(\chi^2_1\)-distributed, and
Wilk's Theorem does not hold: under \(H_0\), the parameter \(\beta\) of
Mittag-Leffler distribution is equal to \(1\), and hence lies on the
boundary of the parameter space \((0,1]\). Instead, a valid approach is
a bootstrapped Likelihood-ratio test (see e.g.~Davison et al., 1997).
Figure \ref{Fig:LRT} displays the (simulated) power for the bootstrapped
LRT for Mittag-Leffler distributions with varying tail parameters based
on 1000 simulation runs. As expected, the power decreases for tail
parameters close to one, since the Mittag-Leffler distribution converges
as \(\beta \uparrow 1\) to an exponential distribution; it becomes hard
to differentiate a Mittag-Leffler distribution from an exponential.

\section{Inference on Exceedance
times}\label{inference-on-exceedance-times}}

The Theorem in Section \ref{sec:scaling} implies that for a high
threshold \(\ell\) we may approximate the distribution of \(T(\ell)\)
with an \({\rm ML}(\beta, b(1/p_{\ell}))\) distribution, where the
function \(b(c)\) varies regularly at \(\infty\) with parameter
\(1/\beta\). Building on the POT (Peaks-Over-Threshold) method, we
propose the following estimation procedure for the distribution of
inter-exceedance time \(T(\ell)\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Extract the \(K\) largest order statistics (i.e.~the \(K\) largest
  values, where e.g.~\(K = 300\)) \(X_{(1)}, \ldots, X_{(K)}\) together
  with their timestamps \(T_{(1)}, \ldots, T_{(K-1)}\).
\item
  Choose a minimum number of exceedances \(K_0\leq K\),
  e.g.~\(K_0 = 5\), and for each \(k\) ranging from \(K_0\) to \(K\):

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    extract the set \(\mathcal T_k\) of exceedance times between the
    magnitudes exceeding the threshold \(X_{(k)}\)
  \item
    fit a Mittag-Leffler distribution to \(\mathcal T_k\), resulting in
    the parameter estimates \(\hat\beta_k\) and \(\hat \sigma_k\).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Plot \(k\) vs.~\(\hat \beta_k\). To the right (\(k \uparrow K\), low
  threshold), the asymptotics are off and bias is high. To the left
  (\(k \downarrow K_0\), high threshold), data is scarce and variance is
  high. In the middle, look for a region of \emph{stability} for a
  parameter estimate \(\hat \beta\). Choose as \(\hat \beta\) a
  representative value from this region.
\item
  Plot \(k\) vs.~\(k^{1/\hat \beta} \hat \sigma_k\). Again, choose a
  region of \emph{stability} and a representative \(\hat \sigma_0\) from
  that region.
\end{enumerate}

The inferred values \(\hat \beta\) and \(\hat \sigma_0\) can then be
interpreted as follows: Setting the threshold at \(X_{(k)}\), the
threshold exceedance times follow a Mittag-Leffler distribution with
shape parameter \(\hat \beta\) and scale parameter
\(\hat \sigma_0 k^{-1/\beta}\).

To clarify Step 4: Recall that by the theorem,
\(\sigma_k / b(1/p_{\ell})\) is expected to stabilize around a constant
as \(k\) gets smaller. Since \(b\) is regularly varying with parameter
\(1/\beta\), we have
\(b(1/p_{\ell}) = p_{\ell}^{-1/\beta} / L(1/p_{\ell})\) for some slowly
varying function \(L\). Approximating \(p_{\ell}\) by
\(\hat p_{\ell} := k / n\), we have
\[\text{const} \approx \sigma_k / b(1/p_{\ell}) = \sigma_k \times p_{\ell}^{1/\beta} L(1/p_{\ell}) \approx \sigma_k \times k^{1/\beta} n^{-1/\beta} L(n/k)\]
Assuming that the variation of \(L(n/k)\) is minor, we can hence see
that \(\sigma_k k^{1/\beta}\) stabilizes.

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Remark}:]
We approximated \(p_{\ell}\), the probability that an event is larger
than \(l\), by its relative frequency. One could also approximate this
tail probability by the GPD distribution fitted to the exceedances.
\end{description}

For computationally efficient estimates of the Mittag-Leffler parameters
we have used the method of log-transformed moments. This estimation
method provides point estimates as well as confidence intervals based on
sampling variance (Cahoy, 2013), and has been implemented in the R
software package \texttt{MittagLeffleR} (Gill and Straka, 2017). The
stability plots for \(\hat \beta\) and \(\hat \sigma_0\) can be
furnished with these confidence intervals, see e.g.~Figure
\ref{fig:flares}, to produce (non-simultaneous) confidence bands. These
stability plots were produced with the R package \texttt{CTRE} (Hees and
Straka, 2018). We have verified the validity of our estimation algorithm
via simulations, see Section \ref{Simulationstudy}.

\hypertarget{Simulationstudy}{%
\section{Simulation Study}\label{Simulationstudy}}

To test our inference method via stability plots, we have simulated
\(m=100\) datasets with \(n=10000\) independent waiting time and
magnitude pairs \((W_k, J_k)\) for waiting times that follow

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\item
  a stable distribution,
\item
  a Pareto distribution and
\item
  an exponential distribution.
\end{enumerate}

The magnitudes are in all scenarios standard Gumbel distributed. In
order to have exact analytical values available for \(\beta\) and
\(\sigma_0\), a distribution for \(W_k\) needs to be chosen for which
\(b(n)\) from \eqref{eq:stability} is known.

\textbf{Case (i):} For (i) we choose \(W_k \stackrel{d}{=} D\), where
\(D\) is as in \eqref{eq:stability}, then due to the stability property
we have the \emph{equality} of distribution
\(W_1 + \ldots + W_n \stackrel{d}{=} b(n) D\), for
\(b(n) = n^{1/\beta}\). Using the parametrisation of Samorodnitsky and
Taqqu (1994), a few lines of calculation (see e.g.~the vignette on
parametrisation in Gill and Straka, 2017) show that \(D\) must have the
stable distribution \(S_\beta(\cos(\pi \beta/2)^{1/\beta}, +1, 0)\),
which is implemented in the R package \texttt{stabledist} by Wuertz et
al. (2016). By the Theorem, the distribution of \(T(\ell)\) is
approximately \[
{\rm ML}(\beta, p_{\ell}^{-1/\beta}) 
= {\rm ML}(\beta, k^{-1/\beta} n^{1/\beta}),
\] which means \(\sigma_0 = n^{1/\beta}\).

\textbf{Case (ii):} In the Pareto example we choose
\(P(W>t)=Ct^{-\beta}\) with \(C=(1/\Gamma(1-\beta))^{1/\beta}\). We have
chosen \(\beta=0.8\) in both cases (i) and (ii).

\textbf{Case (iii):} We choose exponentially distributed waiting times
with a rate parameter of \(1\).

Figure \ref{Fig:TailSimu} shows the graphical ``stability plots'' for
the estimation of the tail parameter, where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rows correspond to cases (i), (ii) and (iii), and
\item
  columns correspond to estimators (log-Moment estimator,
  Maximum-Likelihood).
\end{itemize}

We plot the tail parameter estimates \(\hat \beta(k)\) against \(k\) for
each of the \(m=100\) simulation runs. Thin grey lines represent
individual simulation runs, and the thicker black line is their mean.
Recall that \(k\) is the index of the order statistics of \(J_k\) at
which the threshold \(\ell\) is placed.

The performance of log-Moment and Maximum-Likelihood estimators for the
tail resp. the scale parameter is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:TailSimu}
resp. \ref{Fig:ScaleSimu}. Both estimators show good performance, with a
slight advantage for the Maximum-Likelihood estimator. This advantage is
paid for with a higher computational cost. Moreover, the bottom row in
Figure \ref{Fig:TailSimu} shows clearly that the log-Moment and
Maximum-Likelihood estimators generalize to the exponential case
(\(\beta = 1\)) whereas the Hill-estimator would not.

\hypertarget{data-example}{%
\section{Data example}\label{data-example}}

We now want to apply the proposed method to a real data example, the
solar flare data which was already mentioned in Section 1 and can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig:thresholdedBursty}. The data were extracted from
the ``complete Hard X Ray Burst Spectrometer event list'', a
comprehensive reference for all measurements of the Hard X Ray Burst
Spectrometer on NASA's Solar Maximum Mission from the time of launch on
Feb 14, 1980 to the end of the mission in Dec 1989. 12,772 events were
detected, with the ``vast majority being solar flares''. To assure
stationarity and due to missing values during the years 1983 and 1984,
we based our analysis just on the year 1982, in which 2,488 events
happened. The list includes the start time, peak time, duration, and
peak rate of each event. We have used ``start time'' as the variable for
event times, and ``peak rate'' as the variable for event magnitudes.

Before we apply the approach described in Section 5 to the solar flare
data, we first have to check if all model assumptions are fulfilled. The
CTRE model is based on three main assumptions, which are repeated below.
For each assumption, we suggest one means of checking if it holds:

\begin{description}
\item[i.i.d.:]
After removing the ``noise observations'' below the smallest threshold
\(\ell_0\), the pair sequence \((T(\ell_0, i), X(\ell_0,i))\) is i.i.d.
An indication if this is true is given by an auto-correlation plot.
Since we are expecting the inter-exceedance times to be Mittag-Leffler
distributed and hence to have infinite mean but finite log-moments, we
first take the logarithms of the times.
\item[Uncoupled:]
Each \(T(\ell, i)\) is independent of each \(X(\ell, i)\). We propose an
empirical copula plot to check for any dependence.
\item[\({\rm ML}(\beta, \sigma)\) distribution of \(T(\ell, i)\):]
Apply a cutoff at the lowest threshold \(\ell_0\), extract the threshold
crossing times, and create a QQ Plot for the Mittag-Leffler
distribution. Use a Log-moment estimate of the tail parameter for the
theoretical / population quantiles of the plot.
\item[\textbf{Remark:}]
The ACF plots of course can just give an indication whether there are
dependencies, since they actually just measure linear dependencies.
Furthermore, if one calculates the ACF for the logarithmic
inter-exceedance times, the ACF indicates on the original scale a
multiplicative dependence.
\end{description}

Figures \ref{fig:flare-diagnostics-1}, \ref{fig:flare-diagnostics-2} and
\ref{fig:flare-diagnostics-3} show the diagnostic plots for a minimum
threshold chosen at the 100th order statistic. There is some residual
autocorrelation for the sequence of threshold exceedance times that is
not accounted for by the CTRE model.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{article_springer_files/figure-latex/flare-diagnostics-1-1} \caption{\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-1} Diagnostic plots for the solar flare data based on the 100 upper order statistics: auto-correlation and cross-correalation function.}\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-1}
\end{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{article_springer_files/figure-latex/flare-diagnostics-2-1}

\caption{\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-2} Diagnostic plots for the solar flare data: empirical copula.}\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-2}

\caption{\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-3} Diagnostic plots for the solar flare data: QQ Plot.}\label{fig:flare-diagnostics-3}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:flares} shows the stability plots for the solar flare
data, on the left for the tail parameter and on the right for the scale
parameter. The dark grey ranges correspond to 95\% confidence intervals,
which are derived from the asymptotic normality of the Log-moment
estimators (Cahoy, 2013) and the \(\delta\)-method (Gill and Straka,
2017); dashed lines show the deduced true values of \(\beta\)
resp.~\(\sigma_0\). The stability plot for the tail stabilizes nicely
around 0.9 (dashed line), while the scale parameter stabilizes less
obviously near \(3 \times 10^7\) (dashed line). The growth of the scale
parameter for lower threshold appears to be closer to linear in
\(p_{\ell}\), rather than proportional to \(p_{\ell}^{1/0.9}\) as
suggested by the Mittag-Leffler fits. The reason for this is likely that
the overall goodness of fit as compared to an exponential distribution
is improved due to the peaked shape of the Mittag-Leffler distribution
near \(0\), rather than its tail behaviour at \(\infty\). The reported
fit should hence come with the caveat that a Mittag-Leffler distribution
models exceedance times well only up to certain time-scales. More
research is needed into the modelling of scale transitions, where
inter-exceedance times appear to have different power laws across
different time scales.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{article_springer_files/figure-latex/solar-flare-tail-scale-1} \caption{\label{fig:flares} Stability plots for the tail and scale parameter of the Mittag-Leffler distribution of the Solar Flare dataset. Dotted horizontal lines are at $\beta = 0.9$ and $\sigma_0 = 3 \times 10^7$ seconds $\approx 0.95$ years.}\label{fig:solar-flare-tail-scale}
\end{figure}

The fit with a Mittag-Leffler distribution (\(\beta = 0.9\)) seems to be
good (see Figure \ref{fig:flare-diagnostics-3}), though there are signs
that the power-law tail tapers off for very large inter-threshold
crossing times. There is no apparent dependence between threshold
exceedance times and event magnitudes seen in the copula plot (see
Figure \ref{fig:flare-diagnostics-2}). We also conduct a bootstrapped
LRT for the null hypothesis of exponentially distributed inter-arrival
times and received a \(p\)-value of \(p<0.01\).

\hypertarget{predicting-the-time-of-the-next-threshold-crossing}{%
\section{Predicting the time of the next threshold
crossing}\label{predicting-the-time-of-the-next-threshold-crossing}}

According to Figure \ref{fig:flares}, for a threshold \(\ell\) at the
\(k\)-th order statistic, the estimated threshold exceedance time
distribution is approximately \[
T(\ell) \sim {\rm ML}(\hat{\beta}, k^{-1/\hat{\beta}} \hat{\sigma}_0), 
\] where \(\hat{\beta} = 0.9\) and
\(\hat{\sigma}_0 = 3.0 \times 10^7 {\rm sec}\). Unlike the exponential
distribution, the Mittag-Leffler distribution is not memoryless, and the
probability density of the time \(t\) until the next threshold crossing
will depend on the time \(t_0\) elapsed since the last threshold
crossing. This density is approximately equal to \[
p(t|\beta, \sigma_0, \ell, t_0) = \frac{f(t + t_0 | \beta, k^{-1/\beta} \sigma_0)}{\mathbf P[T_\ell > t_0]}
\] where \(f(\,\cdot\, | \beta, k^{-1/\beta} \sigma_0)\) is the
probability density of \({\rm ML}(\beta, k^{-1/\beta} \sigma_0)\). The
more time has passed without a threshold crossing, the more the
probability distribution shifts towards larger values for the next
crossing (see Figure \ref{fig:hazard}, left panel). The hazard rate \[
h(t) = \frac{f(t| \beta, k^{-1/\beta} \sigma_0))}{\int_t^\infty f(\tau| \beta, k^{-1/\beta} \sigma_0))\,d\tau}
\] approximates the risk of a threshold crossing per unit time, and is a
decreasing function for the Mittag-Leffler distribution.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{article_springer_files/figure-latex/hazard-1} \caption{\label{fig:hazard} Left: Conditional distribution of time until next threshold crossing, depending on elapsed time $t_0$ since last crossing ($\beta = 0.9$, $\sigma_0 = 1$). Right: Hazard rate depending on tail parameter $\beta$.}\label{fig:hazard}
\end{figure}

The closer \(\beta\) is to \(1\), the more the hazard rate mimics that
of an exponential distribution (a constant function, see Figure
\ref{fig:hazard}, right panel).

\hypertarget{discussion-conclusion}{%
\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{discussion-conclusion}}

We have extended the POT (Peaks-over-Threshold) model, a mainstay of
extreme value theory, to ``bursty'' time series, which have been studied
intensively in statistical physics. Burstiness is characterized by
power-law waiting times between events, and we have shown that the
Mittag-Leffler distribution arises naturally as a scaling limit for the
inter-exceedance times of high thresholds. Moreover, we have derived the
following non-linear scaling behaviour:
\(\sigma \sim p_{\ell}^{-1/\beta}\), where \(\sigma\) is the scale
parameter of the distribution of threshold exceedance times,
\(p_{\ell}\) is the fraction of magnitudes above the threshold \(\ell\),
and \(\beta\) the exponent of the power law. This ``anomalous'' scaling
behaviour in the bursty setting entails two phenomena:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi})}
\item
  a heavy tail of the inter-arrival time distribution of threshold
  crossings (long rests), and
\item
  a high propensity for more threshold crossing events immediately after
  each threshold crossing event (bursts).
\end{enumerate}

The Mittag-Leffler distribution captures both phenomena, due to its
heavy tail as well as its stretched exponential (peaked) asymptotics for
small times. It generalizes the exponential distribution, and in the
solar flare data example, this generalization is warranted, because the
likelihood-ratio test is strongly significant.

When we introduced the CTRE model, we assumed that all events are i.i.d.
This assumption is likely sufficient but not necessary for our limit
theorem to hold. Moreover, any data below a (minimum) threshold
\(\ell_0\) is discarded for CTREs, and hence need not satisfy the i.i.d.
assumption. For the purposes of statistical inference, we merely require
that the inter-threshold-crossing times are i.i.d.

The bursty CTRE approach to model ``non-Poissonian'' threshold crossing
times should be contrasted with the (now standard) approach of clusters
of extremes, see e.g.~Ferro and Segers (2003). In this approach, i.i.d.
event sequences of magnitudes are generalized to stationary sequences of
event magnitudes (subject to a mixing condition). The two approaches are
fundamentally different: Clustering assumes that each event belongs to
one particular (latent) group of events. For bursts, however, the aim is
to identify an underlying scale-free pattern in the event dynamics,
which is often characteristic of complex systems. It is an interesting
open problem to develop criteria, based e.g.~on measures of surprise
(Lee et al., 2015), that guide an applied statistician in the choice
between a clustering and a CTRE approach for a particular problem. In
sum, the CTRE approach should not be seen as a substitute for the usual
cluster approach, but rather as a complementary approach.

Moreover, it was observed in Towe et al. (2020) that clusters of extreme
events still exist after declustering. We believe it is possible to
marry the clustering approach with our CTRE approach by considering
CTREs based on MRPs with a \emph{stationary}, rather than i.i.d.,
sequence of magnitudes, so that the times between clusters are
asymptotically Mittag-Leffler distributed. More broadly speaking, the
identification of clusters in the context of heavy-tailed inter-arrival
times is an open problem.

Finally, a purely scale-free pattern for event times may be too rigid an
assumption for some bursty time series, because often the heavy-tailed
character of the inter-arrival time distribution does not hold at all
time scales. Rather, it applies at short and intermediate time scales,
and is truncated (or tempered, reverting to an exponential distribution)
at very long time scales (see e.g.~Meerschaert et al., 2012; and Aban et
al., 2006). In such situations, a ``tempered'' Mittag-Leffler
distribution may provide a more realistic fit, which we aim to introduce
in follow-up work.
